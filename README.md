  #The itch.io Bundle Video Game Recommender


<a href="https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality"> Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality </a> from <a href="https://itch.io/"> itch.io </a> was a huge hit. For a minimum donation of $5, those who donated gained an access to a library of 1741 digital items, including video games, game assets, soundtracks, comics, books, and much more.

I was determined to address the frustration that may come with getting so many choices at once: after my donation, the amount of games was so overwhelming that I did not know where to start! 

I decided to build a <b>content-based recommender engine</b> that would solve this problem for me, and other gamers who own the bundle. Since many well-known websites have already made their recommendations who they thought the best games in the bundle were, I wanted to take a different approach. Lesser-known developers also deserve the chance of a mention.

That is why this project relies solely on <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>, and recommends games based on their content. The content of the games is described mainly by <b>tags</b> (entered either by the developer on itch.io, or by users on steam), the <b>genre</b> of the game, and a <b>short decription</b> of the video game by the developer.

The itch.io Bundle Video Game Recommender uses publicly available datasets created by users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/theredmist"> u/theredmist </a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/azura26"> u/azura26 </a>, and are accessible on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/itchioJusticeBundle/"> itchioJusticeBundle subreddit </a>. Thanks so much for this amazing resource!
